# Input manipulation and display by the user
 
Task: Write a small JavaScript or PHP program on an HTML page that displays a product page with a shopping cart and everything else that belongs on a product website for a simple display. The product should start with an order quantity of 1 and have the same price up to 5. Then from 6-10 there should be a different price and a small text change or note indicating a quantity discount. Last but not least, there should be a maximum order quantity of 10 and if a user tries to exceed this or enters a higher number manually, another message should appear informing the user that the maximum order quantity per order has been reached.

Short list of tasks/specifics:
Create a simple product page with filler text and images with responsive design
Possibility for users to change the order quantity either manually by entering it or using +/-
Setting of different ranges and display of prices, dynamic content, etc.
Quantity 1 as starting quantity
Quantity 1-5 normal price quantity
Quantity 6-10 with 25% discount with a text overlay showing that there is a quantity discount from here onwards
If a user tries to enter more than 10, this should be denied and a message should appear that the maximum number of items per order is 10.
